A Sea Block Config
Bug fixes:
- Added missing science packs to Logistics System 3, Logistics Warehouses, and Logistics Silos
Changes
- Disable machines in bob assembly machines



Somehow "Starting area size" is only disabled when both "Enemy Bases" and "Angel's enemy multiplier" disabled??

Can we add a new Map Type: Sea Block? When type "Island" is selected, setting "Water" gets replaced with "Island Size" and "Coverage" is disabled.

Can we completely hide Enemy Expansion, Evolution? Setting them to nil causes error

default_enable_all_autoplace_controls doesn't seem to work? Maybe because the preset doesn't include any autoplace controls, just had the default ones.


Optional mods:

Bob ores:
Thorium

KS Power:
Wind turbines

Landfill Painting:
Landfill options. Default type is configurable in Sea Block startup options.

Bob mining:
Pickaxe research

Bob inserters:
